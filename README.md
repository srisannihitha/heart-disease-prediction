Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the US, affecting people from a wide range of
demographic backgrounds. Despite significant research and preventive measures, many individuals remain at risk
due to factors like high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, and more. These factors continue to pose serious threats to
public health, emphasizing the need for new and effective strategies to identify, understand, and tackle them.
This project aims to delve into the vast dataset comprising responses from over 30K+ adults, extracted as
part of the 2022 annual CDC survey. This extensive dataset holds valuable insights waiting to be discovered,
providing a deeper understanding of how different risk factors interact and affect heart health. By using advanced
machine learning techniques like classification and regression algorithms, we aim to uncover important patterns and
connections hidden within the data. Through thorough analysis and validation, the predictive models developed have
the potential to transform early detection and intervention methods for addressing heart disease.
The main aim of this effort is to give healthcare professionals strong tools and knowledge to find people at
higher risk of heart disease early on. This means they can act quickly by suggesting lifestyle changes or medical
treatments, which could prevent serious heart problems and make people healthier overall. Also, creating precise
prediction models could help shape public health policies and decide where to focus resources, so interventions and
preventive actions can be customized for different groups of people. By employing advanced machine learning
algorithms on vast datasets, our aim is to reveal concealed patterns and develop predictive models that could
transform early detection and intervention methodologies. The central objective of this endeavor is to advance public
health by comprehensively understanding the etiology of heart disease, providing proactive measures, and mitigating
its prevalence
